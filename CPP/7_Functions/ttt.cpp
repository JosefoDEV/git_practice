// Tic-Tac-Toe is a papar-and-pancil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking
// the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
// The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row
// wins the game.
// See example below where player X wins (horizontal marks)
// |X| |O|
// |X|X|X|
// |O| |O|
// Loops: This program should use a for loop or while loop to iterate through the player turns.
// Vectors: This program should use a vector or an array to hold nine positions of the 3x3 grid.
// Functions: This program should be modular.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
